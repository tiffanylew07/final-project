# Tiffany L.
## About Me
My name is Tiffany, and I am currently a senior at Mt. Eden High School. Next year, I will be attending San Jose State University and I will be majoring in communications! <br>
## About My Project
This portfolio is the culmination of everything I’ve learned in computer science this year. It showcases my growth as a programmer and web developer through projects I designed and coded myself. Over the year, I learned the basics of C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — including functions, arrays, loops, conditionals, and responsive design. I also gained a better understanding of how computers and the internet work, while improving my problem-solving, logic, and creative skills through each challenge and project. <br>
## My Site Includes:
    ● An About me section with simple facts about me
    
    ● A projects section showcasing my projects from throughout the year with a description and link to each project
    
    ● My contact information with a link to my email
## Projects:
    ● Stopwatch: A simple stopwatch displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. Features start, stop, pause, and reset buttons. Perfect for sports, cooking, or any other daily tasks!

    ● Notes App: A handy notes app that lets users input notes, switch between light and dark mode, and organize notes into separate boxes for easy management.
    
    ● Guess the Number Game: A number guessing game with three difficulty levels: Easy (unlimited attempts, numbers 0–10), Medium (10 attempts, numbers 0–50), and Hard (5 attempts, numbers 0–100). Guess the number and get hints along the way! 
    
    ● Memory Card Game: A matching card game where players flip cards to find pairs. Three levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard (with a 60-second time limit). Features a timer and restart button for extra fun.
